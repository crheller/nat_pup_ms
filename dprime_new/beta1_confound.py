Demonstrate why the overlap of beta1 and dU is negatively correlated with delta dprime.
This is because if ellipse A and B are slightly tilted away from each other, and 
beta1 is along the prinicpal axis of these ellipses, dU will be perp to beta1, but
beta1 will have a big effect.
We can see this because dU big minus dU small is super correlated with first order improvements
