1) First order model schematic / example cell?. r_test for pup vs. pup0. Show gain results (and DC?)
    - Consider showing breakdown of FS vs. RS (if we see an effect for decoding weights)

2) Delta noise correlations.

3) (?) Can't predict delta noise correlations from first order effect magnitude.
    - Or show this as supplementary figure
